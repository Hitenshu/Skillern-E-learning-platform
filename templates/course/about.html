        <p class="lead text-center">
            Welcome to <strong>Skillern</strong> â€” Education accessible to everyone, anytime, anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Skillern is a personal e-learning project developed to explore and demonstrate modern web development and online education technologies. Designed using Django and Bootstrap, the platform enables learners to browse courses, watch videos, track their progress, and earn completion certificates.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project represents my vision to create a flexible, user-friendly learning space for students, professionals, and anyone eager to grow. From interactive content to real-time progress tracking, Skillern continues to evolve as a practical learning companion.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the platform grows, I aim to introduce features like quizzes, discussion forums, and personalized recommendations to enhance the learning experience further.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
            Thank you for being a part of this journey. I hope Skillern adds value to your learning goals and inspires continuous growth.
